Some, but not all, also sell live animals. They are referred to as “wet” owing to the fact that floors are often hosed down after vendors wash vegetables or clean fish.</p><p>Wet markets that sell live animals can risk creating the types of dangerous conditions where viruses can spread from animals to humans, due to the close quarters and potentially unsanitary practices – especially, if they keep rare animals or those captured from the wild, experts say.</p><p>The 2003 SARS epidemic, for example, was linked to the sale of civet cats in Guangdong province.</p><p>Most wet markets, however, are not virus petri-dishes filled with exotic animals ready to be slaughtered.</p><p>For a large proportion of people in China and across Asia, they are just places to go to buy fresh food, such as chicken, pork, fish and vegetables, at affordable prices.</p><footer><strong>CNN</strong><cite><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/14/asia/china-wet-market-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html">Chinas wet markets are not what some people think they are</a></cite></footer></blockquote><p>To put it blunt, there were indeed certain amount of wet markets do slaughter illegal wildlife - but that only makes a tiny fraction of them. </p><blockquote><p>Although some of the markets sell wild animals, the vast majority of them do not.

Wet markets are vital to meeting the day-to-day needs of ordinary people across the world - by strict definition, the famous Fish Market in Sydney also fall in the category of wet market.</p><p>WHO has made their point - wet markets are not born evil, if they are well regulated:</p><img src="/2020/04/26/Wet-Market-reopened-in-China-Yes-and-No/who.png" class="" title="WHO"><p>Up till now, there has been no sign or proof that the wildlife trading is active in China.</p><h1 id="Do-Chinese-people-eat-bats"><a href="#Do-Chinese-people-eat-bats" class="headerlink" title="Do Chinese people eat bats?"></a>Do Chinese people eat bats?</h1><blockquote><p>‘Chinese people eating bats, then coronavirus came out.’ has been a popular theory on social media after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, and it got the endorsement from several celebrities, politicians and for sure, Fox News and OAN.</p><p>The accusations always come with viral videos of ‘Chinese eating bat soup’. Nevertheless, no proof could support that the videos were filmed in China - while a few were filmed in Palau and Indonesia, verified by a French media.</p><p>Videos of Asian people selling or eating bats have been circulating on social media since news broke of the coronavirus outbreak in China, with claims that bats are a possible origin of the new virus.

A new study shows that the early known victims had no contact with the market. And although the virus, at present, does seem to have originated in bats, it’s unclear how it made its way to humans.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="What-We-Heard"><a href="#What-We-Heard" class="headerlink" title="What We Heard"></a>What We Heard</h2><p>There is a conspiracy on internet that, Corona Virus (offical name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2">SARS-CoV-2</a>), was made by scientists and escaped from a lab in Wuhan China, where the outbreak began.</p><a id="more"></a><p>As <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/is-covid-19-a-bioweapon-five-conspiracy-theories-around-coronavirus-that-will-shock-you/the-biggest-humanitarian-crisis/slideshow/74870568.cms">The Economist Times</a> reported:</p><blockquote><p>According to an ET Prime report, a group of Chinese scientists in Canada were accused of spying and were stripped of their access to Canada’s National Microbiology Lab (NML) which is known to work on some of the most deadly pathogens.</p><p>The alleged ‘policy breach’, highlighted the bioweapon program of other countries including China. Dr Francis Boyle, the creator of Bio Weapons Act, also claims that ‘the coronavirus is an offensive biological warfare weapon with DNA-genetic engineering’.</p><p>Again, the claims about coronavirus being a biological weapon are unsubstantiated.</p><p>The first prominent personality to come out publicly and support the theory was the US senator Tom Cotton who appeared on Fox News to allege that the virus could indeed have originated from the lab.</p></blockquote><p>Vox also <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/4/21156607/how-did-the-coronavirus-get-started-china-wuhan-lab">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Conspiratorial claims about the Wuhan lab are circulating on cable news and social media…let’s note who is spreading rumors about the origins of the virus.</p><p>First, several prominent US conservative pundits and politicians — known to regularly spew nonsense (and bash China) — have been politicizing the bioweapon rumor for weeks.</p><p>“It probably is a ChiCom laboratory experiment that is in the process of being weaponized,” right-wing radio host and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Rush Limbaugh said of the virus on February 24. “All superpower nations weaponize bioweapons.”</p><p>Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) has repeatedly suggested before Congress and on Fox News that the virus could have come from the lab.<br><img src="/2020/04/04/No-CoronaVirus-Is-Not-A-Man-Made-Bioweapon/TomCottonTwitter.png" class="" title="Tom Cottons Twitter"></p></blockquote><h2 id="Fact-Checking"><a href="#Fact-Checking" class="headerlink" title="Fact-Checking"></a>Fact-Checking</h2><p>Tremendous scientists and media have confirmed <strong>this conspiracy is NOT true</strong>.</p><p><strong>Example 1</strong></p><blockquote><p>SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe disease, whereas HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E are associated with mild symptoms6. Here we review what can be deduced about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from comparative analysis of genomic data. We offer a perspective on the notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which they could have arisen. </p><p><strong>Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.</strong></p><footer><strong>Nature Journal</strong><cite><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9">The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2</a></cite></footer></blockquote><p><strong>Example 2</strong></p><blockquote><p>The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),1 and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife as have so many other emerging pathogens.This is further supported by a letter from the presidents of the US National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine13 and by the scientific communities they represent. *<em>Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus. *</em></p><footer><strong>The Lancet Journal</strong><cite><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30418-9/fulltext?rss=yes">Statement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China combatting COVID-19</a></cite></footer></blockquote><p><strong>Example 3</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>A preliminary scientific paper shows this is a genuinely new virus, and there’s no way it could have been engineered by humans</strong><br>In a recent podcast episode, Racaniello discussed with two other researchers a fascinating preprint paper (that’s currently under peer review, according to the authors) about the virus origin. The key finding: that SARS-CoV-2 is “not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus.”</p><p>The paper, which was uploaded onto Virological.org in February, is written by several leading microbiologists who closely examined the SARS-CoV-2 genome.</p><p>Specifically, they found the unusual biochemical features of the virus could only have come about two ways after the virus jumped from animal to humans, or what’s called zoonotic transfer. The ways, they write, are: “1) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and 2) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.”</p><p>In other words, nature came up with these weird characteristics in the genome, either in an intermediary animal between bats and people or in humans after the virus infected one. As Racaniello put it on his podcast: “Humans could never have dreamed this up.”</p><footer><strong>Vox</strong><cite><a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/4/21156607/how-did-the-coronavirus-get-started-china-wuhan-lab">No, COVID-19 Coronavirus Was Not Bioengineered. Here’s The Research That Debunks That Idea</a></cite></footer></blockquote><p><strong>Example 4</strong></p><blockquote><p>A new analysis of SARS-CoV-2 may finally put that latter idea to bed. A group of researchers compared the genome of this novel coronavirus with the seven other coronaviruses known to infect humans: SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, which can cause severe disease; along with HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E, which typically cause just mild symptoms, the researchers wrote March 17 in the journal Nature Medicine.</p><footer><strong>Live Science</strong><cite><a href="https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-not-human-made-in-lab.html">The coronavirus did not escape from a lab. Here's how we know</a></cite></footer></blockquote><p><strong>Example 5</strong></p><blockquote><p>In fact, there is not only a lack of evidence supporting these conspiracy theories, there has been growing strong scientific evidence against both of them (China or US made this virus).</p><footer><strong>Forbes</strong><cite><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/03/17/covid-19-coronavirus-did-not-come-from-a-lab-study-shows-natural-origins/#4a092db03728">No, COVID-19 Coronavirus Was Not Bioengineered.
